# LZ77 Compression and Decompression

This repository contains an implementation of the LZ77 algorithm, a lossless data compression method. The program provides efficient compression and decompression algorithms for reducing the size of data files.

## Features

- Compression: The program takes an input string and compresses it using the LZ77 algorithm. It generates a sequence of tokens representing the offset, length of the match, and code word for each compressed segment.
- Decompression: The program can also decompress a sequence of tokens generated by the compression algorithm, reconstructing the original input string.

## Functionality

- Adjustable Parameters: The program allows you to adjust the window size, search buffer size, and look-ahead buffer size in the code. Modify the `window_size`, `search_buffer`, and `look_ahead_buffer` variables in the code to customize these parameters based on your requirements.
- Compression Output: The compressed output is displayed as a sequence of tokens in the format `<offset, length of match, codeword>`. Each token represents a compressed segment of the input string.
- Decompression Output: The program can decompress the sequence of tokens generated during compression and reconstruct the original input string.
- User Input: The program prompts the user to enter an input string for compression and decompression.
